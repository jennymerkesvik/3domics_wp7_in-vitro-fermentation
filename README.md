# 3D'omics WP7: <i>in vitro</i> fermentation of the porcine caecal microbiome

Repository for processed data and code for statistical analyses and visualisations of an <i>in vitro</i> fermentation study conducted as part of 3D'omics ([website](https://www.3domics.eu)), a project in the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme.

The study has given rise to the following works:

<b>1. In vitro modeling of the structure and metabolism of the procine cecal microiota in response to β-mannan exposure</b>
<br>This 2025 manuscript is included in the PhD thesis of Lars Jordhøy Lindstad, titled "Exploring utilization of β-mannans in gut microbiomes - key enzymes and beneficial properties". Norwegian University of Life Sciences, ISBN 978-82-575-2196-7, ISSN 1894-6402.

<b>2. <i>Short article</i>: In vitro modeling of the structure and metabolism of the procine cecal microiota in response to β-mannan exposure (preliminary title)</b>
<br>Planned article for publication in a scientific journal, and for use in the PhD thesis of Jenny Merkesvik, tentatively titled "Holo-omic data analysis to unveil host-microbiota interactions shaping animal production". Norwegian University of Life Scieces.
